		Yesterday I received a strange email from the top offering me, no, more like requesting me to take 
		a break and go on holiday to Lake Superior in Michigan in the company lodge with Katheryn and 
		Annie. It’s such a crucial time in the process of storing I.Y.N.X. away after the test, am I going to be let off?
		  
		I didn’t even know we had a lodge near Lake Superior as well…

		We’ve begun work on developing an all purpose artificial intelligence with the goal of improving the
		lives of its user and environment. I’ll be leading a massive team to undertake this project, an A.I. of 
		this caliber has never been attempted before. The A.I. has been given the name of IYNX, named 
		after the Greek nymph who was morphed into the bird of the same name, being a symbol of love.

		It’s only in the early stages of development but it’s looking promising, if we pull this off humanity 
		may be able to finally rest. We’ll be testing it in a secure device for safety reasons, so as to control
		it if anything were to go wrong. But what possibly could?

		Today we had a “Family and Friends” visiting day. I always hate these, but Annie always insists I 
		bring Katheryn in to see what I do. We aren’t supposed to bring family members into the testing 
		labs, but I didn’t want to go through the smoke and mirrors tour again this year. So I snuck 
		Katheryn in and and let her test IYNX with her own personality chip. As she put in the chip IYNX 
		asked for voice recognition, which I thought its implementation wasn’t planned until next week. 
		Something must’ve been wrong with Katheryn’s chip though as the testing device screen was 
		empty and then shut down some seconds later. Some weird glitch maybe? I don’t know, there’s 
		still so much I don’t fully understand about this A.I. yet.

		Staying back late tonight to fix some bugs in IYNX’s system and got hungry, so I went out for a 
		walk around the block to look for a bite to eat. I found this diner where the sign had been so worn 
		down by the weather I couldn’t make out the name, it was completely barren inside bar a single 
		pot plant and broken jukebox. I ordered a Mac N’ Cheese since it claimed to be just like “Mom’s 
		recipe.” Maybe it was the sleep deprivation that did this, but they were right. It actually even tasted 
		better than Mom’s back home in Arizona. I have to take Katheryn here, she’s going to love it.

		Hi John,
		
		We’ve changed the code to access IYNX’s functions to 628564 as part of the system update.

		The speech capabilities of IYNX were formally tested today and everything went as planned, but it 
		was....strange. Maybe I’m burnt out and going crazy but IYNX’s voice sounded eerily similar to 
		Katheryn, as if she were an adult. Was this some kind of joke by the crew working on IYNX’s 
		speech?
